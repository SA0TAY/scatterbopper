An alternative CW learning method

Basically, I want to experiment with an approach slightly different to the Koch
method. Instead of blasting 20 words or so at the student at once, I want to
subject the student to single words at full speed and proper spacing, having the
student type the full word only at the end of each listen, and then make the
words longer as the accuracy improves.

My idea is that this, unlike conventional Koch, might be better for learning
head copy, as it encourages the student to copy and remember longer and longer
stretches of code as opposed to having them become CW stenographers.
